[Jan 15, 21:05] Jack: @Karan urgency level high. Legacy Logistics (Chicago client) is freaking out.
[Jan 15, 21:06] Karan: about?
[Jan 15, 21:07] Jack: Timestamps. Their reports are in UTC. They need local time.
[Jan 15, 21:10] Karan: I can make it configurable but it's a schema change. 2 days work.
[Jan 15, 21:11] Jack: We launch in 10 hours. Hardcode the default config to "America/Chicago".
[Jan 15, 21:12] Karan: seriously? tech debt ++
[Jan 15, 21:13] Jack: Just ship it.

[Feb 02, 10:15] Jack: Update on Auth. Auth0 Enterprise is $15k/mo.
[Feb 02, 10:16] Eldiiar: 💀
[Feb 02, 10:17] Karan: That burns 20% of our runway.
[Feb 02, 10:20] Jack: Correct. We are building our own auth.
[Feb 02, 10:21] Karan: ugh. jwt, refresh tokens, security... fine. I'll spec it out.

[Mar 03, 10:45] Yazdan: uh guys... I think I deleted Project Alpha.
[Mar 03, 10:46] Karan: What?
[Mar 03, 10:47] Yazdan: My terminal was pointing to prod. I thought it was local.
[Mar 03, 10:48] Jack: @Karan restore from snapshot immediately.
[Mar 03, 11:30] Jack: We are back online. 2 hours data loss.
[Mar 03, 11:35] Jack: Policy change: "WRITE" permission no longer includes "DELETE".
[Mar 03, 11:36] Jack: Only admins get explicit DELETE permissions now.

[May 20, 14:00] Jack: Vote time: ORM vs Raw SQL.
[May 20, 14:01] Jack: Benchmarks: Raw SQL is 4x faster (1.1s vs 4.2s).
[May 20, 14:02] Karan: I hate debugging ORMs. Raw SQL.
[May 20, 14:03] Eldiiar: Performance is key. Raw SQL.
[May 20, 14:04] Yazdan: I abstain (never used raw sql).
[May 20, 14:05] Jack: 3-0. We go with Raw SQL. Yazdan, comment your queries heavily.
[Jun 12, 15:20] PagerDuty: [CRITICAL] Worker Queue backed up (500k jobs).
[Jun 12, 15:21] Jack: It's the "BLOCKED" status. Circular dependency loop.
[Jun 12, 15:25] Jack: We are removing the BLOCKED status enum.
[Jun 12, 15:26] Sarah: Use a "blocked" label instead. Labels don't trigger logic.

[Jul 28, 16:00] Jack: Retro topic: Story Points.
[Jul 28, 16:01] Karan: Kill them. Waste of time.
[Jul 28, 16:02] Eldiiar: Agree.
[Jul 28, 16:03] Jack: Done. Removing story_points column from Task model.

[Aug 14, 11:00] Jack: Load test results. DB dies at 50 req/min.
[Aug 14, 11:01] Jack: Setting rate limit to 47.
[Aug 14, 11:02] Karan: Why 47?
[Aug 14, 11:03] Jack: 6% safety buffer. Do not change this number.

[Sep 01, 09:30] Jack: Legal says "Soft Deletes" are illegal for GDPR.
[Sep 01, 09:31] Karan: seriously?
[Sep 01, 09:32] Jack: Yes. We have to Hard Delete (physically remove rows).
[Sep 01, 09:33] Jack: Watch out for orphaned records.

[Oct 12, 10:14] Eldiiar: Users hate the UUIDs. Hard to read over the phone.
[Oct 12, 10:20] Jack: Let's use TF-XXXX-XXXX (8 chars).
[Oct 12, 10:21] Karan: Low collision chance. I like it.
[Oct 12, 10:22] Jack: Approved.

[Nov 10, 14:00] Yazdan: Can I delete legacy.py? Code is ugly.
[Nov 10, 14:01] Karan: NO. DO NOT TOUCH.
[Nov 10, 14:02] Karan: Acme Corp still uses v1. Check the migration doc.

[Dec 10, 13:00] Jack: Security audit flagged GUEST role.
[Dec 10, 13:01] Jack: They can dump the user table.
[Dec 10, 13:02] Jack: Deprecating GUEST role. Migrating everyone to VIEWER.
